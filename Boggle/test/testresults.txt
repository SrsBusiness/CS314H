1.jar:
    newGame() can instantiates boards with empty square if cubes ends with a new line.
    
    Dictionary only added words at least 4 characters long (which is fine), but wasn't
    in the assumptions
    
    Dictionary returns null iterator when empty dictionary is loaded

2.jar:
    getAllWords() following setGame() returns empty collection of strings
     
3.jar:
    
    getAllWords() following newGame() returns empty collection of strings
    getAllWords() should not include words less than 4 characters
    newGame() should print an error message if it failed to create a new board
    
    When Dictionary is loaded with an empy dictionary, iterator.hasNext() returns true instead of
    false

    iterator.next() should return a NoSuchElementException when there is no next rather than a
    NullPointerException

4.jar:
    newGame() should print something more descriptive than just NoSuchElementException
    when there are not enough cubes
